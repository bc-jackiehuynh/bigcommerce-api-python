        product descriptions. You want to provide detailed yet concise information
        that will entice potential customers to buy.<br \/><br \/><strong>Keep three
        things in mind:<\/strong><br \/><br \/><strong>Think like a consumer<\/strong><br
        \/>Think about what you as a consumer would want to know, then include those
        features in your description. For clothes: materials and fit. For food: ingredients
        and how it was prepared. Bullets are your friends when listing features &mdash;
        try to limit each one to 5-8 words.<br \/><br \/><strong>Find differentiators<\/strong><br
        \/>Pepper your features with details that show how the product stands out
        against similar offerings. For clothes: is it vintage or hard to find? For
        art: is the artist well known? For home d&eacute;cor: is it a certain style
        like mid-century modern? Unique product descriptions not only help you stand
        out, they improve your SEO.<br \/><br \/><strong>Keep it simple<\/strong><br
        \/>Provide enough detail to help consumers make an informed decision, but
        don&rsquo;t overwhelm with a laundry list of features or flowery language.
        Densely pack your descriptions with useful information and watch products
        fly off the shelf.<\/p>","search_keywords":null,"availability_description":"","price":"29.0000","cost_price":"0.0000","retail_price":"0.0000","sale_price":"0.0000","calculated_price":"29.0000","sort_order":0,"is_visible":true,"is_featured":false,"related_products":"-1","inventory_level":0,"inventory_warning_level":0,"warranty":null,"weight":"0.5000","width":"0.0000","height":"0.0000","depth":"0.0000","fixed_cost_shipping_price":"0.0000","is_free_shipping":true,"inventory_tracking":"none","rating_total":0,"rating_count":0,"total_sold":0,"date_created":"Sun,
